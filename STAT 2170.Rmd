## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
pm25 <- read.csv("pm25.csv", header = TRUE)
pairs (pm25, panel = panel.smooth)
```

```{r}
cor(pm25)
```

**Comment**: There is moderate correlation between pm25 and temperature, significant negative correlation to humidity, weak negative correlation to wind, and no correlation to precipitation.
